two driven jocks help fax my big quiz
fickle jinx bog dwarves spy math quiz
public junk dwarves hug my quartz fox
quick fox jumps nightly above wizard
five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed
the five boxing wizards jump quickly
pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
when zombies arrive, quickly fax judge pat
woven silk pyjamas exchanged for blue quartz
the quick onyx goblin jumps over the lazy dwarf
foxy diva jennifer lopez was not baking my quiche
my girl wove six dozen plaid jackets before she quit
grumpy wizards make a toxic brew for the jovial queen
a quivering texas zombie fought republic linked jewelry
all questions asked by five watched experts amaze the judge
back in june we delivered oxygen equipment of the same size
the wizard quickly jinxed the gnomes before they vaporized
we promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize
jim quickly realized that the beautiful gowns are expensive
